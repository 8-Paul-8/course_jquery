    <h3>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</h3>
    <h3>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</h3>
    <h3>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</h3>
    <h3>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</h3>

    </ul>
    <h3>In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</h3>
    <h3>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</h3>
    <h3>There are lots of other JavaScript frameworks out there, but jQuery seems to be the most popular, and also the most extendable.</h3>
    <h3>Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:</h3>
    <ul>
