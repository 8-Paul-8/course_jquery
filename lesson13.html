            ---jQuery - The noConflict() Method
            As you already know; jQuery uses the $ sign as a shortcut for jQuery.
            There are many other popular JavaScript frameworks like: Angular, Backbone, Ember, Knockout, and more.
            What if other JavaScript frameworks also use the $ sign as a shortcut?
            If two different frameworks are using the same shortcut, one of them might stop working.
            The jQuery team have already thought about this, and implemented the noConflict() method.
        
            The noConflict() method releases the hold on the $ shortcut identifier, so that other scripts can use it.
            You can of course still use jQuery, simply by writing the full name instead of the shortcut:

            $.noConflict();
            jQuery(document).ready(function(){
                jQuery("button").click(function(){
                    jQuery("p").text("jQuery is still working!");
                });
            });

            You can also create your own shortcut very easily. The noConflict() method returns a reference to jQuery, that you can save in a variable, for later use. Here is an example:

            var jq = $.noConflict();
            jq(document).ready(function(){
                jq("button").click(function(){
                    jq("p").text("jQuery is still working!");
                });
            });

            If you have a block of jQuery code which uses the $ shortcut and you do not want to change it all, you can pass the $ sign in as a parameter to the ready method. This allows you to access jQuery using $, inside this function - outside of it, you will have to use "jQuery":
            $.noConflict();
            jQuery(document).ready(function($){
                $("button").click(function(){
                    $("p").text("jQuery is still working!");
                });
            });
        */
    </script>
