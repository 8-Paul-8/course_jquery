            ---jQuery Method Chaining
            Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the other).
            However, there is a technique called chaining, that allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same element(s).
            Tip: This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.
            To chain an action, you simply append the action to the previous action.
            The following example chains together the css(), slideUp(), and slideDown() methods. The "p1" element first changes to red, then it slides up, and then it slides down:
        
            $("#p1").css("color", "red")
                .slideUp(2000)
                .slideDown(2000);
        */
